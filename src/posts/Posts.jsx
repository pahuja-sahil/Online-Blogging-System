        title="What’s the Internet Like Today?"
        date="September 20, 2023"
        desc="Every day as I get my son ready for daycare, I recite seven words: “Hey 
             Google, what’s the weather like today?” The results from this now-‘ritual’ 
             search dictate what he’ll wear, what type of extra clothes I will pack, 
             and whether we’ll need a jacket for the bike ride.

             Whatever way you seek to learn the day’s forecast, the medium that 
             you’re consulting isn’t physically measuring or predicting the weather
             but is relaying the measurements and predictions of those that do in a 
             digestible manner. The Internet plays a significant role in distributing 
             and communicating this information but also helps meteorologists collect 
             data from all parts of the world, including remote sensors, to improve 
             these predictions.
       
            Meteorologists will be the first to admit they don’t always get their 
            predictions right. However, they do an exceptional job considering the 
            thousands of different factors they need to account for, and hundreds 
            they can’t, to determine why it rained in one neighborhood but didn’t 
            in the next. The fact that you can get such localized weather conditions 
            is a modern marvel that most take for granted.
       
            Considering society’s reliance on reliable, secure, and increasingly fast 
            Internet connectivity, measuring the Internet is similarly important and 
            challenging as predicting the weather and measuring the climate. It’s why 
            we established Internet Society Pulse, which in many ways works like your 
            weather app to provide a snapshot of the health, availability, and evolution 
            of the Internet.
       
            While the Internet is not bound by geopolitical borders, it’s natural that 
            many people are interested to know the strengths and weaknesses of the 
            Internet in their own country. The Internet Society Pulse Country Reports 
            help with this by consolidating and providing context surrounding the four 
            Pulse research themes for every country, state, and region globally." />

        title="Pain Expands Our Capacity For Joy"
        date="January 5, 2023"
        desc="Daily, my work requires me to delve into the hellish reality of unimaginable 
              experiences of gross abuse. Neither words nor images can fully convey the 
              emotional crises, psychological torment, and heart-wrenching pain that my 
              daughters in these places have been forced to endure. When I feel like 
              giving up under the weight of violent injustice, I am reminded of their 
              stories. The survivors who refuse to give up, live into the new day—graciously 
              extending themselves on behalf of others through their advocacy efforts, through 
              their educational dreams, and through their compassion for other versions of 
              themselves. Their shared experiences with me give me hope to also live into 
              the new day—pursuing the vocational call toward justice once more.

              In this journey of learning to love, my community of survivors taught me how. 
              When words could not express the pain in hearts—we would sing and we would dance, 
              we would cry and we would laugh—we would remind ourselves of the beauty we see 
              in each other. I’ve seen that they are not defined by their past of trauma, but 
              they are thriving through their rewritten stories—stories that are filled with 
              audacious dreams. When given the opportunities to pursue those dreams again, we 
              see that brokenness is not something to be hidden—but unveiled as a thing of beauty.

              At every juncture of grief where my spirit was cracked to the point of no return, 
              came an experience that mended it back together—reminding me that these survivors 
              were the leaders I’ve been waiting for. It became very clear to me that the oppressed 
              would be the ones to lead us into liberation. Through their stories, their wisdom, 
              through their experiences of pain and their models of love, survivors have the potential 
              to become the most powerful leaders in our midst.
      
              I have learned that healing is hidden in the most unexpected places—in brokenness, in pain, 
              in despair, in suffering because that is where love’s presence is a necessity. Just as light 
              coexists together with darkness to make a photograph visible, the juxtaposition of seemingly 
              opposing attributes have the potential to expand the capacity of our heart.
      
              Pain expands our capacity for joy—simultaneously deepening and elevating our heart’s potential 
              to experience a broader spectrum of pain and joy together. Without the experience of pain, we 
              wouldn’t know what joy could be. I never knew what it was like to laugh unrestricted until 
              being in community with survivors who have experienced so much pain, yet were able to laugh 
              with freedom. They taught me how to experience joy, observe beauty, embody hope, and expand 
              in love in ways that I never knew before."

      title="Un-Gendered Clothing: A Guide To Breaking Stereotypes"
      date="October 4, 2023"
      desc="A remarkable shift has been noticed in the fashion industry in recent years – a shift towards 
            genderless or androgynous clothing. We live in a time when comfort precedes gender, and it’s 
            high time we stop restricting clothing to that. This movement has broken down those barriers 
            in order to allow you to express your style without conforming to societal norms. From Ranveer 
            Singh embracing skirts to Billie Eilish rocking oversized T-shirts and shorts on stage, you have 
            enough inspiration to include unisex pieces in your wardrobe. People from all walks of life are 
            embracing this trend, making it more than just a fleeting fad. It’s time you join in, too.
            
            If you’re thinking that genderless apparel is a new idea, you’re mistaken because its origins 
            can be traced back to the early 20th century. Fashion icons like Coco Chanel and Princess Diana 
            defied gender stereotypes by mixing typically masculine aspects into their looks. With some 
            trailblazing celebrities of the 21st century, this movement achieved significant traction.
            
            One notable figure, when it comes to fashion, genderless included, is Harry Styles. The former 
            One Direction member has become a true style icon, often seen challenging gender stereotypes 
            with his choices. He has graced the covers of many magazines donning flamboyant blouses, floral 
            patterns, and skirts, all while exuding confidence and charisma. He is an inspiration to countless 
            individuals who are willing to explore and experiment with fashion.

            Another celebrity who has made waves in the genderless fashion realm is Ranveer Singh. The 
            multi-talented actor is renowned for his signature-style ensembles. His genderless fashion choices 
            combine classic tailoring with a touch of playfulness. He is known for his extraordinary style – 
            wearing long skirts, hot pink power sets, gender-neutral drapes, print-on-print, lots of bling, and 
            an all-inclusive colour palette. This might be extravagant for you, but you can always take inspiration 
            from him and tone it down in your own way."

      title="Arcade Fire and the mixed reviews of “Everything Now"
      date="November 18, 2023"
      desc="This song never fails to uplift me when I am having a bad day. It has a certain ‘something’ which I 
            would describe as the hope for change within the relentless and insatiable drive of material world. 
            ‘Arcade Fire’ are a Canadian Indie rock band who were formed in 2001 by Win Butler, Josh Deu and his 
            partner Regine Chassagne.
            
            Listening to this is like taking a deep breath in an letting go of all of the stresses and strains 
            you feel inside. Released on June the 1st 2017 as part of their fifth studio album, “Everything Now” 
            definitely has it’s place as a song that has highlighted the nihilist culture of the time.

            The chorus has a repetition of the phrase “everything now” which has an effect of emphasising two 
            different meanings – the fact that people want it all now and sooner and also that if we could just 
            be present for long enough, we would realise that we actually do have ‘everything now.’ 
            
            The song is quite tongue and cheek hinting at the emptiness and banality of the corporate, 
            materialistic world. It’s almost like they don’t want to be a part of it but feel they have 
            no choice but to be. The fact that they posted a website mocking their own work beforehand 
            was an interesting move, almost as though it’s better for them to give themselves a bad review 
            before anybody else does.
            
            We are living in a world where snap judgements are made without any reason or contemplation. 
            If we slow down and just respond rather than react to what we read online and consider the source 
            first, we may actually find a deeper meaning and understand the artistry more which I can think is 
            the case here. Great artists find ways to hold a mirror up to the world and this song in particular 
            is no exception. Amidst the noise and chaos, if we are quiet enough, we may still be able to hear and 
            connect with our own truth and that is the gift that music creates."

      title="The Effect of Sports on Mental Health"
      date="November 1, 2023"
      desc="Active work has for quite some time been related with worked on actual wellbeing, however its significant
            impact on emotional well-being is a subject of expanding interest and exploration. Participating in sports
            and customary activity can emphatically affect one's psychological prosperity.
            
            One of the most remarkable advantages of taking part in sports is the decrease of pressure and tension. 
            Practice sets off the arrival of endorphins, frequently alluded to as 'warm hearted' chemicals. These 
            endorphins go about as normal temperament lifters, assisting people with feeling more loose and less 
            focused. Group activities, specifically, offer social cooperation and a feeling of kinship, further 
            easing pressure and nervousness.
            
            Exercise and sports can be compelling apparatuses in the fight against discouragement. Actual work 
            expands the development of synapses like serotonin, which are connected to mind-set guideline. 
            Participating in sports can give a feeling of motivation and design in one's regular routine, which 
            is particularly vital for people battling with discouragement.
            
            Many games, like yoga and judo, underline the psyche body association, advancing unwinding and stress
            decrease. These exercises include care and reflection, which can be especially gainful for psychological 
            well-being. Rehearsing care can assist people with dealing with their feelings and adapt to pressure all 
            the more successfully." />

      title="Scribblings of a Cinema-obsessed Mind"
      date="April 17, 2020"
      desc="The first episode of Garland's latest kicks off giving a pretty good picture of what's to come. A meditative 
            mood piece, with its somber tone, dissonant score, mesmerizing images and a brooding atmosphere; very much 
            a wet dream of any serious cinephile.

            Revealing much about the plot would do it disservice. Those familiar with the excellent 'The OA Part II' will 
            probably find some thematic similarities, although 'Devs' is more on the sci-fi/tech side and less dense, plot 
            and characterization-wise.
      
            'Devs' manages to hold our attention to a considerable degree, with its intriguing story-line and hypnotic 
            camerawork. At its core is a heartbreaking story of love, loss and an obsessive desire to overcome this loss. 
            For those who crave some cerebral content in their cinema, there is a lot to chew on with its subject material 
            and heavy verbiage concerning quantum physics, free will, the multiverse theory, the De Broglie–Bohm theory and 
            what not! You will probably have to google all that up!
            
            
            Also baffling is the choice of a female actor to play the wunderkind Lyndon (Cailee Spaeny). She tries hard but 
            comes off as awkward pretending to be a smart-ass geeky 'boy'.

            The two actors who shine in the whole affair are Nick Offerman as Forest and Zach Grenier as Kenton, his loyal 
            security in-charge. They add the much needed edge to the proceedings and make us cheer, their moral compasses 
            notwithstanding.

            Despite the shortcomings, 'Devs' is certainly worth the ride. Check it out on Hulu or Hotstar.
